# Examples

This directory will contain examples for different programming languages and use cases with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

## Planned Directory Structure

The following directories are planned to be added as examples are developed:

- `javascript/` - JavaScript and Node.js examples
- `python/` - Python examples  
- `java/` - Java examples
- `go/` - Go examples
- `rust/` - Rust examples

## Example Categories

Each language directory will include examples for:

1. **Code Generation** - Having Copilot Agent generate code from descriptions
2. **Code Review** - Using Agent Mode to review and improve existing code
3. **Testing** - Generating unit tests and test cases
4. **Documentation** - Creating and improving code documentation
5. **Refactoring** - Restructuring and optimizing code
6. **Bug Fixes** - Identifying and fixing issues

## How to Contribute Examples

To add examples to this playground:

1. Create a new directory for your programming language (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add a README.md with specific instructions for that language
3. Include well-commented example files demonstrating Agent Mode features
4. Follow the example categories listed above

## Current Status

This examples directory is currently being populated. Check back for language-specific examples as they are added to the repository.
