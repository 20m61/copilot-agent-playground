# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Playground

A playground repository for testing and experimenting with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode features.

## What is GitHub Copilot Agent Mode?

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is an advanced feature that allows developers to interact with AI agents that can help with various development tasks through natural language conversations.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a sandbox environment for:

- Testing Copilot Agent Mode capabilities
- Exploring different AI-assisted development workflows
- Experimenting with various programming languages and frameworks
- Learning how to effectively collaborate with AI agents

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this playground effectively, you'll need:

- **GitHub Copilot subscription** - An active GitHub Copilot subscription
- **Compatible IDE/Editor** - VS Code, Visual Studio, Vim/Neovim, JetBrains IDEs, or other Copilot-supported editors
- **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** - Ensure Agent Mode is enabled in your development environment

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/20m61/copilot-agent-playground.git
   cd copilot-agent-playground
   ```

2. **Verify Copilot Agent Mode is working**
   - Open your preferred IDE with the cloned repository
   - Test Agent Mode by asking Copilot to help with a simple task
   - Ensure you can interact with the AI agent through natural language

3. **Explore the examples**
   - Check the `examples/` directory for available examples
   - Start with simple code generation tasks to familiarize yourself with Agent Mode
   - Experiment with different types of AI-assisted development workflows

4. **Start experimenting**
   - Create new files in your preferred programming language
   - Use Agent Mode to assist with coding, debugging, and documentation tasks
   - Try the different interaction patterns described in the examples

## Examples

The `examples/` directory is designed to contain practical demonstrations of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode capabilities across different programming languages and scenarios.

### Planned Example Types

- **Code generation and refactoring** - Learn how to describe requirements and let Agent Mode generate code
- **Documentation assistance** - Use AI to create and improve code documentation
- **Testing strategies** - Generate comprehensive test suites with Agent Mode
- **Bug detection and fixes** - Collaborate with AI to identify and resolve issues
- **Architecture discussions** - Engage in technical discussions about system design

### Example Languages

Examples will be provided for popular programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, and Rust. Each language directory will include specific use cases and best practices for that ecosystem.
